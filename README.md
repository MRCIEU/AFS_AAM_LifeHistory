# AFS_AAM_LifeHistory
The scripts in this repository are for conducting the analysis in Lawn et al., Using Mendelian randomization to investigate life history theory: the effects of age at menarche and first sexual intercourse on reproductive and behavioural outcomes.

The scripts relate to two separate exposures (Age at menarche and Age at first sex) and scripts 7 and 8 need to be edited to read in either exposure. 
The data for the exposures is included in the manuscripts supplementary material with full SNP lists used for analyses. 

Scripts:
1.	Making phenotype data file.do
2.	Tidying phenotype data file.do
3.	Extract_all_mr_paper_snps.sh
4.	Create_recoded_genotypes.sh
5.	Preparing genetic data to merge with phenotype file.R
6.	Generating outcome summary statistics.R
7.	Mendelian Randomization IVW WM Egger.R
8.	Mode Based Estimator MR.R
9.	Descriptives.do
